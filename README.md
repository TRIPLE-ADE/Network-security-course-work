# Network-security-course-work

## Description

This project is part of my Computer Network and Security course and focuses on implementing user authentication and session management using Firebase. The project aims to provide a practical application of the concepts learned in the course and enhance understanding of network security practices.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality.
- Secure password storage using Firebase.
- Session timeout for user inactivity.
- Sidebar navigation with toggle functionality.
- Logout functionality.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Firebase (Authentication and Realtime Database)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Firebase project and configure the Firebase SDK in the `firebase-config.js` file.
3. Open the project in a web browser or host it on a web server.

## Usage

1. Register a new account using the signup form.
2. Login with your registered account.
3. Navigate through the sidebar links to access different sections.
4. A session timeout will automatically log you out after a period of inactivity.
5. Use the logout button to manually log out.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are securely stored using Firebase's authentication mechanisms.
- Session timeout ensures that inactive users are automatically logged out.
- User data is stored in Firebase's real-time Database.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the Computer Network and Security course.
